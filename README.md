# CODE VERDICT - an Online Judge

*From the very first year, when I embarked on my journey in Competitive Programming (CP), I came across many remarkable platforms like CodeForces and Codechef. I always wondered about the internal working of those platforms. 
Although, the primary objective is not to entirely replicate all the features but to create a product that delivers value to the user through a judicious selection of essential features. It is a go-to-use product in software domain as I look from my perspective.*

So here, I present Code Verdict, an Online Judge using Django from scratch. Django being a high-level, open-source web framework in Python, is simple and easy to learn. It has a built-in admin panel and authorization system. It follows the ***Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY)*** principle, hence reducing redundancy. 
I tried my best to follow DRY principle. It is commonly used by many famous companies such as ***Instagram, Youtube and Spotify***. 

The final product aims to allow users to submit their code in multiple programming languages, execute it and generate a verdict in real-time environment. The system will be constructed with a focus on ensuring robust security and scalability.

**LET'S  DIG  IN  WITHOUT  FURTHER  ADO !!**

Now, a common misconception arises and people equate an Online Judge with an Online Compiler. In layman terms, Online Compiler is a subset of Online Judge.

Here is the basic difference between them : 
### **Online Judge**
> It is a platform where a user submits their code and receives a verdict based on the judgement system. Here, Input is provided in form of predefined test cases and compared with the corresponding predefined Output. 
> It is commonly used for competitive programming, coding contests, and practicing problems for DSA.
>> Example - CodeForces, Codechef

### **Online Compiler**
> It is a tool that allows users to write, compile, and execute code online without any local compiler in their system. It is mainly used for quick code testing, debugging, and experimentation.
> Here, no verdict is passed by the system, rather only output is generated. Also, providing Input may or may not be necessary.
>> Example - OnlineGDB, Programiz

# How to start using Code-Verdict ðŸ¤”
Well, I will be dicussing mainly 2 ways on how to use this online judge on your local machine.


## Using Docker
***Pre-requisites***
<ol>
  <li>Docker account with Docker Desktop in local machine</li>
  <li>VS Code or any code-editor</li>
</ol>

***Steps To Follow***
- Firstly, **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
  - Open a folder (recommended to create a new folder) in VS Code
  - Now, let's create a virtual environment inside this folder
      ```python
      python -m venv myenv
      ```
    Replace **'myenv'** with any desired name you want
  - Now, run this command inside your terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict.git
    ```
    
- Great, now let's get inside the Code_Verdict folder in your current directory
  ```bash
  cd code_Verdict
  ```
  
- Install all the requirements needed. Don't worry, it's quite simple  ^_^
  ```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Let's create our docker container now...
  ```docker
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
  
- After the download is completed, head over to the Docker Desktop application inside your local machine
  - Press Windows key and type **"Docker Desktop"** in search bar to open
 
- You will observe something like this inside the app
  ![image](https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict/assets/118092124/6e0a4008-5b16-479b-b41d-753d5bd02aae)
  In Images section, you will observe there are 2 images created named postgres which is our database and code_verdict-web which contains whole django app.

  
  - If your container appears to be orange like below
    ![image](https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict/assets/118092124/b089a09d-d491-4808-85bc-26c3b15c8e0e)
    
    Follow the instructions mentioned below step-wise :
    - Click on "code_verdict" written near the orange icon
    - Stop both the containers using â–  icon on right. After stopping, both should look like below :
      <img src="https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict/assets/118092124/d32068c4-ccee-458a-9833-06a57ece3c59" width="300" height="200">
    - Now, start only the postgres_db using â–¶ icon on right
      ![image](https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict/assets/118092124/dd61cdf7-5ee5-4e11-b460-a5d697415bc2)
    - When you see the following line in logs section : "database system is ready to accept connections", now your database is ready.
    - Start the django_container using â–¶ icon on right
    - If you get same message as below, then your containers are in sync and working
      ![image](https://github.com/Devankar-iitP/Code_Verdict/assets/118092124/049acf5f-a7e3-4dbc-b091-5cd0c6a5c0a3)
      If not, then again perform these debugging instructions from start at an interval of 10 seconds


- If your container is green then you are good to go now.

- Click on highlighted link
- Congratulations !! Now, you are part of Code_Verdict team.
  HAPPY CODING ðŸ˜€

***Key Notes***
- Admin is already created with username = "root" & password = "admin"
  - If you want your own custom superuser
    ```python
    python manage.py create superuser
    ```
    Set the username & password accordingly
- All data is stored in data folder
- If you want to be employee, then give permission from admin for approval
- ***This system is NOT connected to main SERVER. It's like a virtual playground for your own experiments.***

## Using EC2 instance on AWS

***Pre-requisites*** - Frankly speaking, you have to only click on the below link

***Note - Since, I am a student and using free-tier on AWS account. This link only works if my instance is running on AWS. So, be careful !!***
